## A Rust API for [Hypothesis](https://web.hypothes.is/)
### Work in progress

Based on the [Hypothesis API (1.0.0)](https://h.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-reference/v1/).

To Do:
- [X] Annotations
- [ ] Groups
- [ ] User
- [ ] Profile

Caveats:
- RangeSelector doesn't seem to follow [W3C standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#range-selector). It's just a hashmap for now.
- Need to figure out how Document works to properly document it (hah).
